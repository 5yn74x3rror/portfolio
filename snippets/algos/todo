1.
- find number of all anagrams for a given word

2.
Given 9 space-separated integer numbers, output the maximum clock time can be formed using those numbers.

Note:
- Not all numbers need to be included.
- Each number can only be used once.

remote channels going up or down from 0 to 99:
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    a, b = [int(j) for j in input().split()]
    print(min([(a-b)%100,(b-a)%100]))

    4.
    Given a guitar string s and a fret f, find the note produced if we pluck the string at this fret.

The notes are EFGABCD and form a cycle. On a guitar neck, these notes are separated by 2 frets except for BC and EF that are separated by only 1 fret.

For exemple:
A2 will produce B
E5 will produce A

For this puzzle we won't bother with altered notes (no # or b), that is you'll never land between notes on the neck.
